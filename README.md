# Loggrep
**Loggrep** is a powerful command-line tool for searching log files, designed to work with timestamps and support advanced features like regex, invert match, context lines, and color output. Itâ€™s inspired by `grep` but tailored for log files, allowing you to search only after a specific startup time.
